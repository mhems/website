  <h1 id="main_title">Guide to remotely accessing LNG computers</h1>
  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <p>
    Since you are remotely accessing the system from the command line, you will only be able
    to use the command line and as such won't be able to open a gedit window or run other 
    standalone applications like Eclipse. Thus, the command <code>gedit myFile.txt &</code>
    or even <code>gedit myFile.txt</code> will give an error since an application window can't
    open from PuTTY and gedit has no equivalent command-line program. This is a motivating factor
    for using in-terminal editing programs like Vim, Emacs, and Nano, which would allow you to
    edit from inside the terminal. If you would like to edit your files using an editor or
    program of your choice, you can <i>ftp</i> the files to your local computer, edit them,
    and then <i>ftp</i> the files back to the lab computers. To get an <i>ftp</i> client,
    download <i>PSFTP</i> along with PuTTY. If on Unix/Linux/Mac, you can simply use the
    <code>ftp</code> or <code>scp</code> commands in the terminal.
  </p>

  <h2>Unix/Linux/Mac Users:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open up a terminal</li>
    <li>Run the command <code>ssh <i>username</i>@bingsuns2.cc.binghamton.edu</code></li>
    <li>Enter your PODS password and press Enter</li>
    <li>You should now be able to <code>ls</code> and see your lab file directory</li>
    <li>When you are done, run <code>exit</code> to end your session and return to your computer</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>PC Users:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>First time only: download <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>For just the PuTTY application itself (all you really need), download just <i>putty.exe</i> and store it in a safe place with a shortcut on your Desktop</li>
      <li>You can alternatively download <i>putty-0.xx-installer.exe</i> which will download the PuTTY suite</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Launch PuTTY</li>
    <li>Type <i>username</i>@bingsuns2.cc.binghamton.edu into the <i>Host Name</i> text box</li>
    <li>Ensure <i>SSH</i> is checked as the <i>Connection type</i></li>
    <li>Select the <i>Open</i> button at the bottom right to launch your session</li>
    <li>Enter your PODS password and press Enter</li>
    <li>You should now be able to <code>ls</code> and see your lab file directory</li>
    <li>When you are done, run <code>exit</code> to end your session and close PuTTY</li>    
  </ol>
