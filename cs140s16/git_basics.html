  <h1 id="main_title">Git Basics to submit your code</h1>

  <h2>Starting from scratch (you haven't pushed or cloned)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new git repository: <code>git init</code></h3></li>
<p>This should not trigger any errors</p>
<li>Add (tell git about) the files you want to submit: <code>git add
FILE1 FILE2 ...</code></li>
<p>This should not trigger any errors</p>
<p>You can add all files in the current directory with <code>git add
.</code></p>
<p>You can add all java files in the current directory with <code>git
add *.java</code></p>
<p>Note: It is not necessary for you to submit .class files or .java~
  files.  The former is the executable byte code that we can obtain
  from compiling your source code.  The latter are backup files that
  editors make for your convenience.  Do not submit your files in an
  archive such as tar, rar, or zip.</p>
<li>Commit your changes locally: <code>git commit -m "Ready to
submit"</code></li>
<p>The message between the double quotes is for your use - it should
describe what you have last changed. Since this is our first commit,
"Ready to submit" or "initial commit" is fine.</p>
<p>This may trigger an error that starts with "Tell me who you
  are". To rectify this, run the two commands:
<p><code>git config --global user.name  "Your Name"</code></p>
<p><code>git config --global user.email "your bing email"</code></p>
<p>and re-run the commit command. You should only have to do this
  once per machine.</p>
<p>If all succeeded, your output should say "X file(s) changed, Y
  insertions, Z deletions" and then a list of items that look like
  "create mode NNN file"</p>
<li>Sync your local changes to your gitlab account: <code>git push
    https://gitlab.com/bu-cs140s16-admins/PROJECT_NAME-YOUR_PODS_USERID.git
    master</code></li>
<p>where PROJECT_NAME is the name of the project (e.g. assignment02,
  lab02, exampractice) and YOUR_PODS_USERID is your PODS user
  name</p>
<p>Note you will need to enter your gitlab user id and your gitlab password</p>
<p>The shell will <b>NOT</b> show your password being typed, just type
it and press ENTER</p>
<p>This is the crucial step that needs to succeed for your
  submission to be valid.</p>
<p>If all went well, you should see a message whose last line ends
  in "master -> master"</p>
<p>You can confirm this by pointing your browser to
  https://gitlab.com/bu-cs140s16-admins/PROJECT_NAME-YOUR_PODS_USERID
  and navigating to Files and checking the files you wanted to upload
  are there with an appropriate timestamp.</p>
<p>There are several errors you could get with this command</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>fatal ... can't find refspec...</i></li>
  <p>Check that the url is properly formed and re-enter your password
    carefully.</p>
  <li><i>Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you
  do not have locally</i></li>
  <p>Check out this <a href="merge_conflicts.html">page</a></p>
  <li>If your error is neither of these two, post to gitlab with the
    command you're trying to execute and the full error message you
    get</li>
</ol>

<h2>You've made some changes in an existing repo (you've already pushed
at least once)</h2>
<p>We can skip Step 1 since its already initialized</p>
<p>Follow above Steps 2 through 4</p>

<h2>You'd like to pick up where you left off (from a different machine)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine: <code> git clone
  https://gitlab.com/bu-cs140s16-admins/PROJECT_NAME-YOUR_PODS_USERID.git</code>
    <p>You now have your files to examine, edit, and re-submit if you
      choose, using the commands outlined above</p>
</ol>
