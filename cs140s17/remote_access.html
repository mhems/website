  <h1 id="main_title">Guide to remotely accessing LNG computers</h1>

  <p>Your file system is accessible online <a href="http://ssl.binghamton.edu">here</a></p>
  <p>Login using your PODS ID and passwords and select the PODS
  domain.</p>
  <p>In the top right group, click <i>My H Drive</i> to download and
    upload your files.</p>
  <p>It may ask you to login again, enter <i>PODS</i> for
  the <i>Domain</i>.</p>
  <p>Checkmark the box next to the files you would like to download
  and then download the zip file that will contains your selected
  files.</p>

  <p>Below the link to your H drive, you can <i>SSH to "Bingsuns"</i>
    to get a remote terminal.</p>
  <p>Since you are remotely accessing the system from the command
    line, you will only be able to use the command line and as such
    won't be able to open a gedit window or run other standalone
    applications like Eclipse. Thus, the command <code>gedit
    myFile.txt &</code> or even <code>gedit myFile.txt</code> will
    give an error since an application window can't open. This is a
    motivating factor for using in-terminal editing programs like Vim,
    Emacs, and Nano, which would allow you to edit from inside the
    terminal. You could also edit the files locally and transfer them
    manually through your H drive.</p>
