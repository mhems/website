  <h1 id="main_title">Git Basics to submit your code</h1>

  <h2>Assuming you haven't pushed or cloned (starting from scratch)</h2>
  <h3>Create a new git repository: <code>git init</code></h3>
  <p>This should not trigger any errors</p>

  <h3>Add the files you want to submit: <code>git add FILE1 FILE2 ...</code></h3>
  <p>This should not trigger any errors</p>
  <p>Alternatively, you can run <code>git add .</code> which will add every file in the current directory</p>
  <p>Or you can run, <code>git add *.java</code> which will add every file that ends with the java extension</p>
  <p>Note: It is not necessary for you to submit .class files or .java~ files.
    The former is the executable byte code that we can obtain from compiling your source code.
    The latter are backup files that editors make for your convenience.
    Do not submit your files in an archive such as tar, rar, or zip.</p>
  <p>You can confirm the files you wanted to add are indeed added by running <code>git status</code>. If you were
    successful in adding them, the output should list those files as "Changes ready to be committed"</p>

  <h3>Commit your added files: <code>git commit -m "Ready to submit"</code></h3>
  <p>The message between the double quotes should be a message describing what your commit entails</p>
  <p>This may trigger an error that starts with "Tell me who you are". To rectify this, run the two commands:
  <p><code>git config --global user.name  "Your Name"</code></p>
  <p><code>git config --global user.email "your bing email"</code></p>
  <p>and re-run the commit command. You should only have to do this once per machine.</p>
  </p>
  <p>If all succeeded, your output should say "X file(s) changed, Y insertions, Z deletions" and then a list of
    items that look like "create mode NNN file"</p>

  <h3>Sync your commit to gitlab:</h3>
  <h3><code>git push https://gitlab.com/bu-cs140-admins/PROJECT_NAME-YOUR_PODS_USERID.git master</code></h3>
  <p>where PROJECT_NAME is the name of the project (e.g. assignment02, lab02, exampractice) and
    YOUR_PODS_USERID is your PODS user name</p>
  <p>Note you will need to enter your gitlab user id and your gitlab password</p>
  <p>This is the crucial step that needs to succeed for your submission to be valid.</p>
  <p>If all went well, you should see a message whose last line ends in "master -> master"</p>
  <p>You can confirm this by pointing your browser to https://gitlab.com/bu-cs140-admins/PROJECT_NAME-YOUR_PODS_USERID
    and navigating to Files and checking the files you want to upload are there with an appropriate timestamp.</p>
  <p>There are several errors you could get with this command, the most likely saying something like "fatal ... can't find refspec ..."</p>
  <p>Check that the url is properly formed and re-enter your password carefully.</p>
  <p>If this does not correct the error, post to gitlab with the command you're trying to execute and the full error message you get</p>

  <h2>Assuming you have already pushed at least once and want to upload changes to the same place</h2>
  <p>We can skip <code>git init</code> since its already initialized</p>
  <p>Start with the <code>git add</code> step outlined above to add the files you've changed.</p>
  <p>Then <code>git commit ...</code> and <code>git push ...</code> as outlined above</p>

  <h2>Assuming you would like to grab code from gitlab in a fresh directory</h2>
  <h3>Clone the repository to your local machine:</h3>
  <h3><code> git clone https://gitlab.com/bu-cs140-admins/PROJECT_NAME-YOUR_PODS_USERID.git</code></h3>
  <p>You now have your files to examine, edit, and re-submit if you choose, using the commands outlined above</p>
